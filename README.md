archon-integration
==================

Integration scripts for archon

This is based on https://github.com/vladikoff/chromeos-apk/blob/master/archon.md, 
files in this project are to to enable seamless integration with gnome. In order
to do manual intagration, files need to go to following folders:

apkrun - /usr/local/bin (make it executable)
android.png - somewhere inside /usr/share/icons
apkrun.desktop - /usr/share/applications

This will enable a click-to-run APK integration into desktop.
